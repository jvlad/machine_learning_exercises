  when you use a regression model, do you follow any formal approach for picking a performance evaluation metric (or a combination of them)?  

    ...MAE/MAPE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared, Adjusted R-squared â€“ I've read through a number of overviews, all are "the best". However, I started wondering if choosing it is a matter of consensus like "use whatever my fellows used".
